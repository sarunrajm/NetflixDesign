                REACT (Front End technology)
            -----------------------------------

            Basic Commands
        -----------------------
        1. to create react app : npx create-react-app project-name
        2. to run react app : npm start

            Features & Concepts
        ---------------------------

        1. Used to build UI with help of Javascript Libraries
        2. Used to built Single page application
        3. Declarative Approach : 
        4. Immutable & Mutable
        5. Pure functions : It sholud not cause side effect
        6. Virtual DOM
        7. Unidirectional Data flow: parent to child
        8. JSX - (Javascript XML)  
            - Every jsx expression should place inside single tag
            - React Fragments : <> </>
            - instead of Attribute class use className
            - instead of Attribute for use htmlFor
            - to display js expression in jsx place js expression inside a {}
            - Every tag should has its closing tag, 
            - Tag without content is represented as self closing tag
        9. Transpiling : converting jsx to (HTML,CSS,JS) - babel Library
        10. to create react app - create-react-app command
        11. React App is consist of one or more components : A tree structure of components with starting component - App Component
        12. Component : Is a small part of UI, return HTML 
            - Is js/jsx file, with filename and component always starts with a Capital letter
            - Different components in react
                - Functional/stateless components
                - Class based / stateful components
        13. Props : used to share data from parent to child
            - it is an object
            - Child component can access shared data via props from its argument
        14. Styling Component using CSS
            - Inline Styling
            - External style sheet
            - CSS Module  : a file with extension as .module.css
        15. React Events Handling
            - without argument : event bind using its function name only
            - with argument : event bind using arrow function
            - with event object : event bind using arrow function with event object
        16. Conditional Rendering
            - if statements : && operator
            - if-else statements : Ternary ?: operator
        17. React State: 
            - predefined object to store property of a class based component
            - when state changes then component re-Render
            - to change value of state - use setState(value)
        18. React Component Lifecycle
            - Mounting phase : Putting all elements into DOM
                - constructor()
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - render()
                - componentDidMount()
            - Updating phase : while updating component
                - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                - shouldComponentUpdate()
                - render()
                - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                - componentDidUpdate()
            - Unmounting phase : Removing component from DOM
                - componentWillUnmount()
        19. React Hooks : provide react Features like state and Life cycle etc to Functional component
            - Import hook from react to Functional component by calling hook
            - Hook can only called at top level of component
            - Hook cannot be Conditional
            - Types of Hooks
                - Predefined Hook
                    - useState(initial-value) : return state and function to updating state
                - Custom Hook 
        20. Rendering List (Array of List) : use map method 
        21. React Forms : handled by component
                - preventDefault() : method cancels the event if it is cancelable
                - Types component 
                    - Controlled component : managed by react component
                    - Uncontrolled component : managed by DOM
